                            <ul>
                                <li>I am building a gradient boosting model using <b>Keras</b> and <b>LightGBM</b> on a <b>Linux</b> environment to detect credit card fraud activity
                                in large transaction datasets.</li>
                                <li>I completed IBM training courses focused on Mainframe technology, z/OS architecture, and JCL scripting.</li>

                                <li>I built a web application using <b>React, Next.js,</b> and <b>Material UI</b> to create a dynamic interface for managing the company's databases. This allowed
                                employees to interact with complex data without requiring coding knowledge, improving overall accessibility and efficiency.</li>
                                <li>On the backend, I designed and integrated <b>RESTful APIs</b> using <b>Spring Boot</b> to streamline CRUD operations on <b>MySQL</b> and <b>PostgreSQL </b>
                                databases.</li>
                                <li>I automated error reporting for <b>Spring Batch ETL pipelines</b> and built a real-time monitoring UI using JavaScript, which reduced troubleshooting time
                                by 80%.</li>
                                <li>I used <b>Docker</b> to containerize applications, standardizing deployments across development, production, and QA environments and streamlining CI/CD workflow.</li>
                            </ul>
